# Elliot-Reproducible-VRSs

This repository provides the most updated versions of visually-aware recommender systems (VRSs) implemented in [Elliot](https://github.com/sisinflab/elliot). This Elliot version was adopted to reproduce all experiments described in the paper **[A Study on the Relative Importance of Convolutional Neural Networks in Visually-Aware Recommender Systems](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350873965_A_Study_on_the_Relative_Importance_of_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_in_Visually-Aware_Recommender_Systems)** (to appear in the Proceedings of the "4th CVPR Workshop on Computer Vision for Fashion, Art, and Design").

**\[\*\*DISCLAIMER\*\*\]: Please, notice that this repository will be deleted as soon as these scripts are merged into the main branch of Elliot.**
