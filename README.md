# Elliot-Reproducible-VRSs

This repository provides the most updated versions of visually-aware recommender systems (VRSs) implemented in Elliot. This Elliot version was adopted to reproduce all experiments described in the paper **A Study on the Relative Importance of Convolutional Neural Networks in Visually-Aware Recommender Systems** (to appear into the Proceedings of the "4th CVPR Workshop on Computer Vision for Fashion, Art, and Design").

**\[\*\*DISCLAIMER\*\*\]: Please, notice that this repository will be deleted as soon as these scripts are merged into the main branch of Elliot.**
